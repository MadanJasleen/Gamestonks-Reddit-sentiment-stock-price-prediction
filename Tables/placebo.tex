\caption{\textit{This table presents the Granger causality results based on stock returns, where the null hypothesis assumes that the column variable does not Granger cause the row variable. Three alternative stocks were chosen based on propensity matching, taking into account factors like market capitalization, trading volume, and volatility to match with GameStop stock. These alternatives, ranked in descending order of matching scores, include ODP (ODP Corp), BBY (Best Buy Co.), FCFS (Firstcash Holdings Inc.), along with the IWM Russell 2000 index. To keep it concise, only the first column of the Granger causality matrix is shown, focusing on how Reddit activity influences stock returns. Data at both the five-minute and daily frequencies were used, covering the period from December 15, 2020, to February 28, 2021. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% level}}
